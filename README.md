### General Info
***
This is a blog app for fans of the Fallout games to get together and share thoughts and opinions. I decided to create this blog because I wanted to create something that people could build on and turn a website into a community.
There are many different components of this blog. They are as follows:  
Homepage - for users to see blog posts  
Categories - for users to view and post items in their prefered category  
Login/Register - Users are able to have their own account, meaning they can control their own posts and build their own following on the app.  
Like/Unlike - Having a like/unlike ability allows users to express opinion and also have the ability to see what posts are popular.  
Edit profile/ settings - Having these functions gives users more control over what people are able to see. By being able to share information by choice and select what other users can see. It is possible for users to create their own online identity.  
Commenting - Having a comment section is yet another way to allow users to share opinions and communicate with one another.  
Overall I am hoping that over time this blog is able to grow and develop along with it's users. There is much more work to be done on the blog, and as time goes on I look forward to developing more and more aspects to the app.  
Below this are a few images of the website in action:
